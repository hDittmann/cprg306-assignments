Pick a group of UI elements to create as components. Your main criteria is that the group and subsequent elements are reusable
Plan out the user stories and scope definitions of what the ui element needs to do
Either in your page.js file, a markdown file, whiteboard, piece of paper (develope's choice)
Do not write code for this step
Answer the questions:
What is/are the use case(s) of the UI element(s)? and who uses it?
What is a minimal definition of done?
What information will change in each application of the code?
Is there any information or styling that will be static on each invocation of the code?
Consider how you will split up the code: (for the sake of the exercise, write your answers down)
Will this be probably used in other files? if yes than it should be it's own component file
Can the component be broken up into smaller elements? if yes, how does it make sense to split it up into pieces?
What splitting is helpful for me to build this now? and what might be more useful to split up after it's been prototyped
Does the component need a layout wrapper (ie: a list of grocery items would have the GroceryItem.js component
but it might be useful to also have a ListGroceryItems.js component that handles an array of objects that are passed to the GroceryItem component.)
